#### Outcomes:

1. Our ideas now is to create some sort of booking system. Either in form of a marketplace where users can rent
different items or a ticket booking system for different events.
    - Any exceptions in the course on how to mange data? How to use a database in an object oriented way. Need
    to ask TA for further guidance.
2. Maven is great and very useful when working with external libraries/dependencies. Easy to configure and use
both with terminal and within Intellij.
3. Emil and Timothy has previous experience with Scrum and using Jira for board management and issue tracking.
Had a short walkthrough on how to use Jira.

#### Assignments:

Everyone should keep thinking about project ideas and come up with user stories and basic structure before
meeting with TA.
