## Discussion items

- How should we distribute work?
- In what order should we do things?

## Outcomes and assignments

#### Outcomes:

- Pull requests and merging went very smoothly.
- Starting to work on database classes and methods.

- Proposed "order of features":
    1. User login and "book" a dummy hardcoded product
    2. Browse real products
    3. Add product
    4. Dummy booking of product
    5. Real booking, request to book. Owner of product has to accept
    6. Payment

#### Assignments:

- Sebastian will continue with implementing users, writing tests and documentation.
- Emil will create a handler for Listing, aswell as test and documentation.
- Erik will work on a class for databases.
- Eimer and Timothy will create controllers and start to connect gui with handlers.


## Wrap up

- Still a bit unclear how to write user stories that are easily distributed in the group.
