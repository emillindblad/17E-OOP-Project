## Objectives

- Refactor handling of scenes.
- Controller classes.
- RAD/SDD

## Reports from previous meeting

- Eimer has implemented creation of accounts but had some issues with branches and merging. Also
ran into problems because refactoring has not been done.
- Erik is done with error handling in db and has started working with the booking part of the model.
- Sebastian continues to work with user settings, resolving bugs.
- Timothy has done some research on how to load images dynamically.
- Emil has been working with validations of form data.

## Discussion items

- Currently all scenes are loaded upon launch. Should be refactored so that scenes are only loaded and
active only when viewing them.
- Need for additional controller classes.

## Outcomes and assignments

#### Outcomes:

- Functionality should be added so that when switching scenes they also fetch new updates from the model.
- Do we need to have external "controller" classes in addition to the fxml controllers. Check with TA
- Need to continue with RAD/SDD.

#### Assignments:

- No new assignments this meeting, everyone continues with their previous assignments.

## Wrap up

- Next meeting on Friday 10:00
