## Outcomes and assignments

#### Outcomes:

- Create a switchTo that takes a Listing and switches to a view with that Listing in it. Most of
the logic is already in place.

- Product has a category: Easy to see which products is in a category.
- Category has a bunch of products: Easy to sort and filter.

Both solutions has its negatives. Only usecase is to filter on categories, can be implemented in current code.

- Give tasks on Monday meeting.
- Take Tuesday for working with feedback.
